# Anton Iosifov — Software Engineering Portfolio

A production-focused portfolio presenting commercial, startup, and independent work across web, mobile, cloud, and AI-enabled systems.

[Live portfolio](https://antoniosifov.com) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-iosifov/) · [GitHub](https://github.com/antoniosifov)

## Overview

The site is a statically exported Next.js application built to load quickly, remain accessible, and present detailed engineering work without turning the portfolio into a wall of technology names.

It includes:

- production client platforms and independently developed products;
- outcome-first project summaries with expandable engineering notes;
- startup, freelance, education, and certification history;
- responsive navigation and keyboard-accessible interactions;
- image lazy loading and optimized WebP assets;
- complete social metadata, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots, and manifest;
- optional privacy-conscious analytics;
- automated deployment to GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20.9+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoniosifov/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Validate a production build with:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The static export is generated in `out/`.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow installs dependencies, builds the static Next.js export, and deploys `out/` to GitHub Pages. The custom domain is retained through `public/CNAME`.

## Optional analytics

Analytics stay disabled unless the following variables are configured locally and as GitHub Actions secrets:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` | Domain registered in Plausible |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_SCRIPT_URL` | Optional custom or self-hosted Plausible script |
